ENTITYCONV

  entityconv is a program that converts special HTML characters to
  entities, and vice versa.

USAGE

  The program reads from file or standard input (stdin), so that you
  can read in a stream from shell:

	entityconv -
	<p>
	&lt;p&gt;

  Or pipe the contents of a file:

	cat paragraph.html | entityconv
	&lt;p&gt;

  You can also operate directly on a file:

	entityconv paragraph.html
	&lt;p&gt;

  It takes a single argument -r, which reverses the escape process
  to unescape instead. This will allow you to pass convert entities
  into HTML.

LIBRARY USAGE

  The functionality of the program is also provided as a Go library.
  You import it from the following canonical location:

	https://github.com/andreastt/entities

  To escape some HTML:

	es := entities.Escape("<p>")
	fmt.Printf("%s", es)
	# produces "&lt;p&gt;"

  To unescape a string with HTML entites:

	us := entities.Unescape("&lt;p&gt;")
	fmt.Printf("%s", us)
	# produces "<p>"
